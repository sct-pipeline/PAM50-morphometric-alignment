# PAM50 : Morphometric Alignment

This repository contains scripts related to the generation of a PAM50 update using morphometric landmarks as the alignment method (instead of discs).

The participants included in this project are the same as the original PAM50, which can be found in the [`whole-spine`](https://data.neuro.polymtl.ca/datasets/whole-spine) dataset.
